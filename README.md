Program Description:	This program implements a client-server model
where a server will execute shell commands for a user. 

Running the server verbosely will give the best output, so make sure to 
use the -v options when run. The help command for server is -h

Running the client verbosely might be helpful too, the same -v option is
needed. The help command is -? for the client, however.

How to build:	make

Make will create two programs, client.out and server.out in the bin/ folder.
